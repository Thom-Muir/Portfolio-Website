					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>
					As part of a rigorous capstone project, my team and I were challenged to apply everything we had learned throughout our Information Systems and Technology bachelor's program. Our task: design and implement an enterprise-grade network supporting e-commerce services, network-based authentication, and an internal email system—all from scratch, within eight weeks. The final system underwent a week-long functional evaluation by the "Orange Team" while simultaneously being stress-tested by a live penetration test from the "Red Team."
					</p>

					<h3>Network Architecture</h3>
					<p>
					Our network was structured into three key segments: LAN, Screened Subnet, and WAN, connected via static routing and secured by a pfSense firewall. The following diagram illustrates the final architecture:
					</p>

					</figure>

					<p>
					The firewall was configured to allow only HTTPS and SQL traffic into the screened subnet while blocking all unauthorized access to the LAN. This ensured secure communication and protected critical resources from external threats.
					</p>

					<h3>E-Commerce Services Deployment</h3>
					<p>
					The foundation of our e-commerce services was a Windows Server running XAMPP for easy management of Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
					</p>
					<p>
					To better secure the database, the write-access account was restricted to localhost to prevent external hijacking. However, the read-only account for the Orange Team was still exposed to on-path attacks. To mitigate this, TLS was deployed to secure their connection. TLS was then extended to our HTTP server for the same reason.
					</p>
					<p>
					The remaining RHEL server was repurposed to run a Python-based honeypot, designed to mislead attackers and slow down penetration testers.
					</p>

					<h3>User Authentication & Access Control</h3>
					<p>
					Active Directory (AD) was configured to allow network authentication for LAN clients, enabling centralized management of user accounts and group policies.
					</p>
					<p>
					The Orange Team was given a read-only restricted account to access information from the e-commerce SQL server.
					</p>
					<p>
					The AD server’s host-based firewall was configured to only allow connections from whitelisted devices, preventing unauthorized IP addresses from attempting login on the LAN.
					</p>

					<h3>Email and Customer Support</h3>
					<p>
					An internal email service was created to allow Orange Team users to file support tickets during the technical evaluation. This service was integrated with the existing AD accounts for consistent Identity & Access Management (IAM).
					</p>
					<p>
					While using AD integration secured the login process with Kerberos, the actual email exchange using POP3 and IMAP remained exposed to interception. The solution was to deploy TLS-hardened versions of these protocols and disable the insecure versions.
					</p>
					<p>
					User support was handled in two ways:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A startup guide (HTML-based documentation) that provided step-by-step instructions on accessing network resources.</li>
						<li>Direct email support for resolving both technical issues and simulated e-commerce concerns (e.g., revising or canceling orders).</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Penetration Test</h3>
					<p>
					Simultaneously with the Orange Team evaluation, a live penetration test was conducted by students from the ethical hacking course. Over the course of the week, the Red Team was moved through various segmented networks to assess their security posture. Rather than solely relying on passive protections, our team took an active approach to incident response.
					</p>
					<p>
					Beyond the TLS-hardened connections, our servers were further secured with strict host-based firewall rules. Because only specific IP addresses were expected, whitelisting was enforced on both the Active Directory and web servers, blocking unexpected devices from connecting.
					</p>
					<p>
					For a more active defense, we conducted real-time network monitoring by reviewing firewall logs and Wireshark packet captures to detect suspicious activity. If unexpected traffic was detected, immediate action was taken to secure the affected subnet. These incidents were also logged and analyzed, later forming a key part of our final presentation.
					</p>

					<h3>Results & Takeaways</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Achieved an A in the course with a fully functional and secure network.</li>
						<li>Successfully defended against penetration testing with no vulnerabilities exploited, and all incidents logged.</li>
						<li>Orange Team reported high satisfaction with prompt and professional support.</li>
						<li>Gained hands-on experience in enterprise networking, security, and server administration.</li>
					</ul>
